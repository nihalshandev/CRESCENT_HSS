            Vanimal Crescent High School was founded in 1976 in the heart of
            Vanimal Panchayat in the eastern hilly district of Kozhikode
            district. The school has played a vital role in educating this area
            where education was backwards. Students of
            this school have been able to achieve different positions at school
            level and in school competitions. The Vavuniya Crescent High School,
            which operates only 8,910 classes, is a vocational school as well as
            in the curriculum as in the field of study, has raised this school
            as a higher secondary school in 2014
